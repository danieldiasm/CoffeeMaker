# CoffeeMaker
The firmware of a automated Coffee Maker based on an Arduino.

I've used some other libraries on my project, which are open source and will be pointed out here sooner o later.

The project is on a very early stage, it a second try of making a conversion of a simple coffee maker into an IoT coffee maker.

This readme will be better soon, I'll also add some other stuff, like schematics, notes and stuff.
